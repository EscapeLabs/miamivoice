<h1>Architecture model</h1>
We will use the C4model to describe the DAOos architecture. I think (314159...) this is a candidate for a standard way of working within Labs3. 

In short (thanks LNow) the C4 model is a way of visualizing software using 4 levels of details:

1) System Context: On this level you only show who will be user of your system, what your system will do (in general) and in what environment it will work on (with what other systems it will have to interact)

2) Container: On this level you zoom in a little bit and show of what kind of high level elements your system should be or will be build. In our case we'll gonna have Clarity contract(s), a fronted application and we also want to use Gaia.

3) Component: On this level you zoom in a little bit again and you show details of each element from 2nd level. You want to show what kind of modules and/or components you want to have in each element. In our case, I only created it for Clarity contract, as other things are still one big question mark for me.

4) Code: Zoom in again, and this time you model every element from 3rd level using standard modeling techniques (mostly with will be UML, ERD, Sequence diagrams etc.)

<h1>Drawing the diagrams and collaborating</h1>

I suggest using draw.io, as Cryptopanter is already familirizing himself with it and LNow already started a concept. 
We will put the current version in this folder so it can be downloaded for local editing with draw.io. 

Do we need a way to inform eachother when it is being worked on to avoid having to integrate changes later?
