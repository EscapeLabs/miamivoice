# daoOS

Background
What problems do you aim to solve? How does it serve the mission of a user owned internet?

Bitcoin was the first Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO. DAOs empower groups of people to organize in a decentralized fashion to prioritize tasks and execute on projects. daoOS is an open source tool that can empower DAOs to organize, vote on priorities, and execute through a single interface. The key problem with decentralized organizations is that it can be challenging organizing around central principals and determining how and what to fund. The result can be unnecessary bureaucracy and often there ends up being some kind of centralized board or leaders who end up making all of the decisions and others can have issues getting their priorities funded.

In a world where apps like Uber and Airbnb are decentralized, it won't be done through a centralized startup - it will be done through a group of drivers or homeowners who want to get it done. And that's where daoOS can provide the platform and process.

Our aim is to create daoOS as an open source tool that anyone can then use to create their own DAO. Empowering users to organize and fund projects in a decentralized fashioned will be at the heart of a user owned internet.

# Project Overview

This app should empower the following for any DAO:

Allowing members to sign up, be approved by the existing organization
Members will be able to post ideas, and these ideas can be fleshed out, budgets and milestones can be set
Members can then commit STX to projects they want to contribute to, when the full budget is met, they can begin working towards the milestones
When a milestone is met, the project owner can post it and have STX released on approval of a majority of anyone who staked STX to that project. This continues until the project has reached completion.
As we advance, we can refine these tools based on the needs of DAOs, and add elements like member subscriptions, the ability to de-couple contributions and voting power, the ability to stack the reserve STX, and whatever else is needed. The primary purpose at this stage will be to simple create an MVP, recruit new DAOs to use i t, and find product-market fit.

Success will be measured by a few factors:

As an open source project, forks, stars, watches and downloads will give visibility into interest in the project.
We will aim to recruit pilot projects and ask that they opt in to share analytics and usage data with us.
Insofar as possible, tracking projects that use this app and their efficacy, as well as satisfaction.
We will build a landing page to gauge interest in a hosted SaaS version and run a simple ad campaign to test messaging.
If there is a need, we will offer a hosted SaaS of this tool, in which case we will be better able to track usage and set KPIs to that effect.

# Milestones

M0: Research Phase. In this phase, we will develop a test case to validate the UX and general functionality of the DAO. We will do a pared down interface, develop the core smart contract(s) that will manage the organization. We will design and develop a basic UI to support these features. Specifically, this first phase will include the following features:

Registration of new users
Authentication of users into the DAO
Add new projects and milestones
Stake STX on projects
Release STX on milestone completion

M0, Task 1 (1-2 weeks, ~30-40 hrs): Design UI, technical architecture
M0, Task 2 (2-3 weeks, ~30-60 hrs): DAO structure: registration and authentication
M0, Task 3 (2-3 weeks ~40-60 hrs): Projects: add, stake, release

M1: This next phase will be polishing the message, finishing design and repurposing the repo (the current project was built for another project and had slightly different specs. We will prep everything we need for a successful MVP of a hosted DAO platform. It is anticipated this will take 6-8 weeks, with the following key tasks:

M1, Task 1 (2 weeks): Landing page to articulate the project and value proposition and gauge need for a hosted version.
M1, Task 2 (2 weeks): Prototyping of Platform MVP in Figma or similar tool.
M1, Task 3 (1 week): Technical plan articulating what development will be needed to adapt including smart contracts, UX and API.

M2: MVP Build and launch will entail putting together the initial platform per requirements and understanding gained in first phase of the users. This part of the project will take 8-12 weeks if we have identified the right team. Specifically, we will do the following (many can be done asynchronously):

M2, Task 1 (6 weeks): Build out smart contracts to support membership, voting, and release of funds for project milestones
M2, Task 2 (2 weeks): Build out API for any data storage needed that won't be handled by smart contracts
M2, Task 3 (6 weeks): Build out PWA client UX
M2, Task 4 (3 weeks): Do user research with DAOs to determine the optimal product features at launch.
M2, Task 1 (4 weeks): If the needed is determined, also build out hosted version and signup
